## Zetpass.com - application for managing credentials.

It's created to manage private data, like passwords, notes and credit cards in safe place.

## Anonymous

Zetpass is conceived as an absolutely anonymous, without using any of user data. You just create username, password and
PIN and use it. No user data like an email, phone, name is needed.

- [ ] create Open API, that allows use Zetpass in side projects.
- [ ] add encryption block
